# Elden Scribe

Elden Scribe is a web application built with Next.js and React, designed to assist players of Elden Ring in quickly and easily constructing messages using the game's extensive vocabulary. Gone are the days of scrolling through long lists of words in each category to find the right one. With Elden Scribe, you can filter all the words in the game, construct messages by piecing together different parts, and view their categories to locate them more easily in the game.
